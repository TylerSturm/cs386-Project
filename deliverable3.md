## Problem Statement, Product Position, and Value Proposition
Traditional **CasinoGame** and **CardGame** experiences often lack dynamic engagement and interactivity, leading to repetitive gameplay and reduced player retention. Our system, **HybridCasinoFPS**, integrates **ShooterGame** mechanics within classic **CasinoGame** to create a more immersive and engaging experience. Unlike traditional **CardGame** experiences that rely solely on chance and strategy, **HybridCasinoShooter** introduces action-based **Combat**, adding depth and skill-based gameplay, appealing to **Users** who enjoy both **CasinoGame** mechanics and shooter elements.  

**HybridCasinoFPS** will support core functionalities such as:  
**Multiple GameModes** including *Blackjack, War, Ride The Bus, and Roulette*, each with distinct **Rules** and mechanics.  
**ShooterGame**, where players engage in **Combat** using **Weapons, Abilities, and Health systems**, influenced by the outcomes of **CasinoGame** sessions.  
**User**, the player, has a balance of a **currency** and plays the games.  
**Combat** including **Weapons**, and **Health systems** are dynamically affected by **CasinoGame** results.  
**Stats**, tracking **kills, deaths, balance**.  
The **Enemy** is an **AI** that the **User** will face in the **ShooterGame**.  
The **betting system** in the game will help the **User** get better **weapons** or **items** for the **ShooterGame**.
