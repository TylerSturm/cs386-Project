## Problem Statement, Product Position, and Value Proposition
Traditional casino game and **CardGame** experiences often lack dynamic engagement and interactivity, leading to repetitive gameplay and reduced player retention. Our system integrates **ShooterGame** mechanics within classic **casinogames** to create a more immersive and engaging experience. Unlike traditional CardGame experiences that rely solely on chance and strategy, CasinoShooter introduces action-based *Combat*, adding depth and skill-based gameplay, appealing to **Users** who enjoy both **CasinoGame** mechanics and shooter elements.

Our CasinoShooter game will support core functionalities such as Multiple **GameMode**s including Blackjack, War, Ride The Bus, and Roulette, each with distinct *Rules* and mechanics. **ShooterGame**, where players engage in **Combat** using *Weapons, Abilities, and Health systems*, influenced by the outcomes of **CasinoGame** sessions. **User**, the player, has a balance of a currency and plays the games. **Combat** including *Weapons, and Health* systems are dynamically affected by **CasinoGame** results. **Stats**, tracking *kills, deaths, balance*. The **Enemy** is an AI that the **user** will face in the **ShooterGame**. The **betting** system in the game will help the player get better *weapons* or items for the **shooterGame**.
