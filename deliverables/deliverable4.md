# Deliverable 4

## Introduction
Our Casino Shooter is a unique blend of casino-style games and shooter action. In our game, players engage in various  
classic card and casino games to determine their loadout, weapons, and abilities for the shooter phase. Based on how well you  
do in each game, you will earn different tiers of weapons, health, and other abilities for when you enter the shooter phase of our game.
In the shooter phase you will face a AI opponent and will be given rewards for winning.

## Tests

**Test framework used:** Unity Test Framework  

**Link to Test folder:** https://github.com/TylerSturm/cs386-Project/tree/main/Tests  

**Class File link:** https://github.com/TylerSturm/cs386-Project/blob/main/code/Ride.cs

## Technology

- **Unity** is a powerful, cross-platform game engine used for developing 2D and 3D games and interactive experiences.  
  We chose it because it offers a wide range of tools and features that make game development efficient, and we have a member who has used it before.
  
- **GitHub** is used for version control, collaboration, and project management. It allows our team to efficiently track changes,  
  manage issues, and review code through pull requests. GitHub helps us maintain a clean development workflow  
  and ensures that only stable, tested code is merged into the main branch.

## Deployment
We are not going to host a server for our game; it will be run locally on the user’s machine. We are going to use Unity built in export system, and it will be available to download on GitHub once released.

## Licensing
This project is licensed under the MIT License –   
Link to LICENSE file: https://github.com/TylerSturm/cs386-Project/blob/main/LICENSE.md  

We chose the MIT License because it is simple, permissive, and developer-friendly.  
It allows others to use, modify, and distribute the game, and freely build upon it for their own projects.  
It only requires that they credit the original creators. This helps encourage community contributions,  
open-source learning, and future expansions.

## UX Design

This is our title screen. It was generated by chat gpt to give the casino feel and tell the user to press space to start.

This is the table we chose for blackjack and war. We liked the simplicity of it combined with the placement of the player card locations.

These are the card pictures we chose. There is a picture for every card in a deck but these are examples.

## Lessons Learned

Looking at what we have done so far, We can see that the game is quite bare bones. We will need to make it look more polished by adding content such as transitions between games and on screen prompts instead of console prompts. Along with this, the current gameplay loop is quite short. We can fix this by adding more game modes or expanding on current ones.  

We also have gotten better at communicating with eachother. We have a group chat that we use more often now. We also learned how big of a project this would be, we have better time mangemnet now
after getting code down and how long that took. Based on what we have done we can get better ideas of how long task will take. We also have tended to do work the day it is due, we have gotten better and started the deliverable earlier to ask questions as well as the worksheets if we didnt finish them in class.
