## Technology

- **Unity** is a powerful, cross-platform game engine used for developing 2D and 3D games and interactive experiences.  
  We chose it becusae it offers a wide range of tools and features that make game development efficient, and we have a member who has used it before.
  
- **GitHub** is used for version control, collaboration, and project management. It allows our team to efficiently track changes,  
  manage issues, and review code through pull requests. GitHub helps us maintain a clean development workflow  
  and ensures that only stable, tested code is merged into the main branch.

## Deployment
We are not going to host a server for our game; it will be run locally on the user’s machine.  

## Licensing
This project is licensed under the MIT License –   
Link to LICENSE file: https://github.com/TylerSturm/cs386-Project/blob/main/LICENSE.md  

We chose the MIT License because it is simple, permissive, and developer-friendly.  
It allows others to use, modify, and distribute the game, and freely build upon it for their own projects.  
It only requires that they credit the original creators. This helps encourage community contributions,  
open-source learning, and future expansions.
