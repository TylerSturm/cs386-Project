# Deliverable 6
## Introduction
Our Casino Shooter is a unique blend of casino-style games and shooter action. 
In our game, players engage in various classic card and casino games to determine their loadout, weapons, 
and abilities for the shooter phase. Based on how well you do in each game, you will earn different tiers of weapons, health, 
and other abilities for when you enter the shooter phase of our game. In the shooter phase, you will face an AI opponent and will 
be given rewards for winning.

## Requirements
Requirement: As a developer, I want the card games to be fully functional and have correct responses.

## Code quality
Describe how your team managed code quality. What were your policies, conventions, adopted best practices, etc. to foster high-quality code? 

## Lessons Learned
We have been a lot better at getting work done on time and not doing it at the last second. We have figured out a better 
system to work on the shooter code altogether. We really don't have anything we want to change since we are making good progress and 
have the base game done essentially.
